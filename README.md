# PlatformIO version of K3NG's Rotator Controller

The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_rotator_controller)

Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_rotator_controller/wiki)

Basically, what had to be done was based on: [PlatformIO's documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/faq/ino-to-cpp.html)

It took awhile to create all the function prototypes.
